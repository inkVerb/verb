# This runs installpostfix and some extra scripts to setup a backup email server on the server
## Prerequisite: setup of course, and verbemail if you wish an email tld other than .email
## Prerequisite: this Verber should be linked to the backup server already.
## Roundcube and PostfixAdmin will be disallowed by running this.

# DEV NOTE: This is by no means finished. It is only a start to set config files.

# How to use:
## ./inkvmailbackmxinstall

# Eg:
## ./inkvmailbackmxinstall

SERVER=$1

/opt/verb/serfs/installinkvmail

# Config settings
/bin/sed -i "s/BOX_NOT_INSTALLED/BOX_NOT_ALLOWED/g" /opt/verb/conf/servermailpath
/bin/sed -i "s/BOX_NOT_INSTALLED/BOX_NOT_ALLOWED/g" /opt/verb/conf/servermailpass
/bin/sed -i "s/PFA_NOT_INSTALLED/PFA_NOT_ALLOWED/g" /opt/verb/conf/servermailpath
/bin/sed -i "s/VMAIL_SERVER/EMAIL_BACKUP_MX/g" /opt/verb/conf/servermailpath

# Finished
/bin/echo "
All set. This is now a backup email server for $SERVER.
